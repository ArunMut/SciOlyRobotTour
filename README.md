# SciOlyRobotTour

For the gui code, ensure that the tasks, launch, and c_cpp_properties .json files are all compatible with your laptop. This will likely change based on where you downloaded your SFML-2.6.2
Every time you want to run the gui, first build it in vscode by doing cntr-shift-b
Then run it how you normally would
After you run it, check the tasks.json file, and press cntr-z if it changed to something else, which likely happened due to the c++ extension in vscode

-----------------------

For the arduino ide code, the test_code is what we ran in harlem because the wheels were misaligned.
The Robot_Tour_Code is the official code file that you should try to build off of, especially when trying to do IMU Code because that has some. Look at both files.
