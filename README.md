For the gui code, ensure that the tasks, launch, and c_cpp_properties .json files are all compatible with your laptop. This will likely change based on where you downloaded your SFML-2.6.2
Every time you want to run the gui, first build it in vscode by doing cntr-shift-b
Then run it how you normally would
After you run it, check the tasks.json file, and press cntr-z if it changed to something else, which likely happened due to the c++ extension in vscode
